## Overview
  This challenge brought many aspects I didn't fully understand yet, so I did the entire project with Kevin Powell's youTube guidance. I feel like I learned so much doing it this way!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process
I followed along with Kevin Powell and got to experience a good workflow.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned so much more about Flexbox and Grid layouts as well as seeing how a media query actually works (which made it all make so much more sense!). I read Josh Comeau's blog post about a custom css reset and really liked the idea of using that regularly.
